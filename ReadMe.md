# The Makeup Brand Search Engine
hello my name is sacoya 
## Introduction
As my first official project I've created a single page application that utilizes HTML, CSS and Javascript. The use for this application is to provide a user friendly experience. Based off the user's input, this application will showcase the ability to asynchronously fetch data from a public api (no need for authentication). With one click of a button a user will have the ability to view various items of makeup products.

### Languages Utilized
This project is strictly created with 3 programming languages of standard HTML, CSS and Javascript. Therefore this application doesn't require any software installation.

#### Usage
As you enter the application, be aware of the simplicity of the outline. The focus will be on the brand name search bar. Use the search bar to type in a particular makeup brand. As you click the  search button, be aware of a pop up message. This pop up message is made avaiable through a click event listener. The use of this pop up is to get user's engaged in the content displayed on the page. Every user input within the search bar will be consoled logged for the usage of developers. For example, if a user types in "Maybelline", that brand name will be console logged within the.
