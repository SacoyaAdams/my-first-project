# The Makeup Brand Search Engine

## Introduction
As my first official project I've created a single page application that utilizes HTML, CSS and Javascript. The use for this application is to provide a user friendly experience. Based off the user's input, this application will showcase the ability to asynchronously fetch data from a public api. With one click of a button a user will have the ability to view various items of makeup products.

### Languages Utilized
This project is strictly created with 3 programming languages of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
